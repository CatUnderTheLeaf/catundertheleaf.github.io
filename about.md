Life happens and sometimes you make a career break. The length varies from couple of month to couple of years. 

Software development doesn't stay the same, it changes with drastic speed. So you need to be like the Red Queen from _"Alice Through the Looking-Glass"_ and keep running just to keep the position.

During my career break I understood that I don't want to continue working in __Front-end Development__. Instead I became more interested in __Computer Vision__, __Robotics__ and __Autonomous Vehicles__.

As expected, getting back into software development after some time away is a big challenge, especially considering my change of interests. Nevertheless I will try my best.
