## Introduction

Everyday most of us have a problem "What to prepare for breakfast, lunch or dinner?" So, why not to make a mobile app?

> Yes, there are already great apps that generate your menu. There is a great project [Eat This Much](https://www.eatthismuch.com/). Now there are lots of useful features and paid subscription. But, when I started making this project it was still in beta test stage and didn't have features that I needed.

I wanted my app to be as simple as possible. so I didn't want to have nutrition plans and calorie counting. I don't count calories, my friends and relatives don't count calories. The only people who count calories are those who have special diets. I just wanted an app that could make me a diverse menu, not just rotations of potatoes/pasta/rice.

When I make a menu I have simple rules:
- At breakfast serve only breakfast meals (no soup/pasta)
- For breakfast use high_carb, free, low_carb products
- For lunch use low_carb, high_carb, protein, fat, free products
- For dinner use protein, free, low_carb, fat products
- On weekends I can make meals with long preparation time

I started to think how to transform this rules into coding as class hierarchies and express rules by writing code inside methods.But then I came across a wonderful article ["Wizards and warriors"](https://ericlippert.com/2015/04/27/wizards-and-warriors-part-one/) and post on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55226942/python-how-to-to-make-set-of-rules-for-each-class-in-a-game). In the article author described a system, where rules are data, not code, and finds it to be more flexible. So I decided to give it a try.

## Images and text

__Wizard icon__ was created from an icon by Freepik - [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/wizard)

__Images__:

- my friends sent me their photos

__Meal ideas__ - I asked my friends to write down what meals they usually prepare in everyday life.

__Text__ - I wrote and translated by myself with the help of Google and DeepL Translators.

## Software

- __Python__ - because I wanted to improve my Python skills
- framework [__Kivy__](https://kivy.org/#home) - because it is easy to use, cross-platform and fast
- [KivyMD](https://github.com/kivymd/KivyMD) compliant widgets - to make the app visually look more native
- I also made custom widgets, buttons and layouts based on KivyMD
- [Plyer](https://github.com/kivy/plyer) - Python API for accessing hardware features of various platforms (Android, iOS, macOS, Linux and Windows)
- __Pytest__ - all backend code is covered with tests
- __kivy.storage.jsonstore__ - is used to save settings
- __UnQLite__ - NoSQL database engine for storing recipes and rules

## Localization

Localization in three languages (English, Ukrainian and Russian) is made using [Babel](https://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/). The user should choose the language at the app initialization and can change it only through new installation.
